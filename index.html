       <h1>Visualizing the Barriers to Park Access</h1>

       <h4>This project seeks to address the issue of park access inequity in cities from a lens of structural racism in urban planning 
        and “people-oriented city design”-transit development that services urban community needs over vehicle infrastructure <sup>4</sup>. 
        Non-profit Trust for the Public Land (TPL) has an indexed ranking of park access in American cities called “ParkScore”. ParkScore uses metrics
        including total park acreage, investment, amenities, access, and equity-sourced from US Census demographic data- 
        to develop an aggregated park access ranking of America’s top 100 cities. In 2022, Washington, DC was 
        designated the most equitable US city in terms of park access with a ParkScore of 84.9, with Mesa, AZ declared the least equitable
        with a score of 31.9 <sup>5</sup>. By comparing the most and the least park equitable cities in the United States, this project hopes to 
        showcase park access inequalities as an issue of inequitable urban infrastructure. </h4>

    <h4>The below maps show the geographic proximity of people-oriented city infrastructure- bike lanes, metro lines, and bus stations- 
      to parks and urban green spaces in Mesa, AZ and Washington, DC. Geographic data for DC bus routes, bike lanes, 
      metro routes, and green spaces were sourced from Open Data DC<sup>7,8,9,10</sup>.
      Geographic data for Mesa light rail route and bus stop locations were sourced from Valley Metro Open Data<sup>11,12</sup>, bike lane data from
      City of Mesa ArcGIS Online<sup>13</sup>, and park data from City of Mesa Park Finder<sup>14</sup>. With regards to public transit, DC's 
      urban infrastructure is far more people-oriented than Mesa's, with a rapid rail transit system and a comprehensive network of public bus stations
      that within proximity of green spaces; particularly in the northwestern quadrant of the city. </h4>

      <sup>*</sup> City of Mesa GIS did not have a publicly available geographic shp file for green spaces, so the coordinates and acreage 
      of each park
      had to be used instead. <br>
      <sup>**</sup>Mesa, AZ has a light rail system while Washington, DC has a rapid rail system. 
      Light rail systems typically use small trains powered by overhead electrical wires, and have a 
      lower passenger capacity and speed as compared to heavy rail or rapid transit rail systems.<sup>15</sup>
